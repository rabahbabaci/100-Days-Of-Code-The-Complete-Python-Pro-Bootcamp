## 💬 Student Feedback

Curated comments from engaged learners:

> “That course will be one of the top 3 most recommended… You will never ‘master’ Python through a course, but you will be competent by the end.” :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
> “I was able to do some sort of work in the course for 100 days… developing that habit became a great foundation and discipline.” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

And:

> “Angela explains very well… the assignments take longer than an hour and often you will spend a couple of days… This is your learning experience.” :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## 📅 Timeline & Expectations

- Aim for **100 coding days**, not necessarily 100 calendar days  
- Expect to spend **2–5 hours/day** once projects intensify  
- Emphasizes real-world problem-solving: students often Google or reference docs during challenges :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Purchase & enroll on Udemy.  
2. Clone the repo and open Day 1 project in PyCharm or Jupyter.  
3. Work daily through lessons & projects; document challenges and solutions.  
4. Push each completed day/project to GitHub for version control and portfolio building.  
5. Engage with the community—support and be supported!

---

## 📈 Outcomes

- Build fluency in Python, from basics to professional-level  
- Diverse portfolio: games, web apps, automation scripts, data analyses  
- Prepared for junior dev roles or further specialization in web, data, or automation

## 🧭 Tips for Success

- *Stay consistent*: daily coding builds momentum  
- *Be curious*: Google or reference docs when stuck—real programming happens outside of tutorials :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- *Reflect & refactor*: revisit early code to apply improved concepts  
- *Share progress*: helps accountability and networking
