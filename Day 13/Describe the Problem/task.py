# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# The loop is iterating starting from 1 (included) up to 20 (excluded)

# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# The if statement set the function to print "You got it" when i equals to 20

# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# I believe it will never reach 20, the max that it can get to is 19.
